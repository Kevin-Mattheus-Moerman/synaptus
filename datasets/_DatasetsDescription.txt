GENERAL NAMING CONVENTIONS
'ptxy'  - p(t,x,y) and variations. Ultrasonic data matrix, 2D or 3D.
'fs'    - sampling frequency [Hz]
'fc'    - transducer center frequency [Hz]
'fLow'  - Lower transducer cutoff frequency [Hz]
'fHigh' - Upper transducer cutoff frequency [Hz]
'cc'    - compressional wave velocity [m/s] (vector for multi-layer experiments)
'thick' - thickness of each layer in the measurement geometry
'xStep' - distance between spatial measurements (also yStep, phiStep etc.)


DATASETS:
"LineScan2D_WireTargets.mat"
A 2D linear scan of four steel wire targets in water, using a 1.5 MHz immersion transducer. The dataset is simple, with a large depth range (150 mm between closest and furthest target), making it useful for testing single-layer 2D focusing algorithms.

"LineScan2D_PinsPlexiAluSDH.mat"
A 2D linear scan of a three-layered structure; four steel pins in water, four side-drilled holes in an acrylic glass block, and four side-drilled holes in an aluminium block. The large differences in wave velocities between the three media makes the dataset useful for testing 2D multi-layer focusing algorithms. The dataset is described in detail in section 4.5.1 in the attached PhD thesis by M.H. Skjelvareid.

"PlaneScan3D_PlexiAluFBH.mat"
A 3D planar scan of a three-layered structure; water (no targets), acrylic glass (four bottom-drilled holes), aluminium (four bottom-drilled holes). The bottom-drilled holes essentially act as point scatterers. The dataset is useful for testing 3D multi-layer focusing algorithms. The dataset is described in detail in section 5.2 in the attached PhD thesis by M.H. Skjelvareid.

"CylScan3D_LeadSpheres.mat"
A 3D outwardly directed cylindrical scan of small lead spheres suspended in water by thin nylon wires, acting as point scatterers. A "slice" from the dataset can also be extracted to obtain an example 2D circular scan. The dataset is simple, with a large depth range, and is useful for testing single-layer 3D focusing algorithms for cylindrical scans. The dataset is described in detail in section 6.3 in the attached PhD thesis by M.H. Skjelvareid.

"CylScan3D_ObjectsInPipe.mat"
A 3D outwardly directed cylindrical scan of a selection of objects placed in the bottom of a pipe, with the scanning surface was centered in the pipe. The dataset was made to demonstrate how CPSM could be used for imaging complex objects. As a curiosity, the scanner was actually a Lego Mindstorm NXT robot controlled from Matlab. The dataset is described in detail in section 7.A.1 in the attached PhD thesis by M.H. Skjelvareid.

"CopperBlock_2degTilt"
A 2D linear immersion scan where object under inspection (a copper block with side-drilled holes) was tilted approximately 2 degrees relative to the transducer scan line. The dataset is used to demonstrate tilt compensation - the wavefield is extrapolated from the original scan line down to the tilted surface of the copper block. From here, regular PSM or Stolt focusing can be used to image the interior of the copper block.

"ArraySteelPins"
A "full matrix" measurement of 0.3 mm steel pins in water, using a 32 element 1D array. The pins were positioned perdendicular to the array axis. The array elements were 20 mm long, with a element pitch of 1 mm and element spacing of 0.15 mm. The elements were curved and focused at 45 mm depth. Parameters:
Transducer center frequency: 	3.5 MHZ
Sampling frequency: 			50 MHz
Measurement window begin: 		40 us

"ArrayCuBlockStationary"
A full matrix measurement similar to ArraySteelPins.mat, but for imaging of the copper block with side-drilled holes. The input signal to the transducer was three periods of a sine signal at the transducer center frequency. Parameters:
Transducer center frequency: 	3.5 MHZ
Sampling frequency: 			50 MHz
Measurement window begin: 		28 us
